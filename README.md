## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to watch the sunrise, but woke up too late or couldn't see it because of the weather? Have you ever wondered
what time the sun would set in a different country as opposed to your own country? Enter SunDial. SunDial can:

- Tell you what time the sun will set and rise each day
- Tell you what the weather will be like when the sun rises and sets
- Keeps track of your favorite locations so you can easily see when the sun will rise and set
in each location
- Alert you when the sun will rise and set each day

From photographers to astronomers, this app is perfect for everyone.
